# ðŸŽ¯ Goals

At Handmade Systems, our motivation to engage in open source stems from our deep love and respect for it. We understand and appreciate the profound impact that the open source philosophy has had on the software development landscape. Open source has made it possible to collectively harness the creativity, expertise, and wisdom of the global developer community, and it's a principle that we cherish.

We believe in giving back to this vibrant community that has given us so much. Our open source projects are our way of contributing to the collective knowledge base, sharing our insights, and fostering innovation in the field. It's our way of saying 'thank you', and of sustaining the collaborative spirit that makes open source so powerful.

To actively support this endeavor, we encourage our employees to participate in open source projects during work hours. We see this not as a distraction, but as a crucial part of their professional development, and as a way to keep our entire team at the cutting edge of technology.

Through these initiatives, we aim to create a dynamic exchange with the community. We aspire to learn from others, and we invite others to learn from us. We are deeply committed to the open source movement, and we look forward to every opportunity it brings for mutual growth, shared understanding, and the betterment of the digital world.
